# Sudoku Solver Kata

[Soduku Solver](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sudoku-solver)

The Sudokus tested against your function will be "easy" (i.e. determinable; 
therewill be no need to assume and test possibilities on unknowns) and can be 
solved with a brute-force approach.

3kyu Level Kata - using PyTest for unit test cases, as usual.
